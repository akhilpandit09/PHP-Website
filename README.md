# Dynamic Website with PHP and MySQL

This project aims to create a dynamic website using PHP programming language and MySQL database. The website allows users to submit their information, including username, email, phone number, and comments, which are then stored in a MySQL database using PHP.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Provides a form for users to input their information.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes MySQL database to store user information securely.
- **PHP Backend**: Handles data processing and database interaction using PHP scripts.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is accessible and usable across different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Used for server-side scripting to handle form submissions and database interactions.
- **MySQL**: Serves as the database management system for storing user information.
- **HTML/CSS**: Used for structuring the web pages and styling the user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Provides front-end framework for responsive design and UI components.

## How it Works

1. **User Input**: Users fill out the input form with their username, email, phone number, and comments.
2. **Data Submission**: Upon submitting the form, the data is sent to the PHP backend for processing.
3. **Data Validation**: PHP scripts validate the input data to ensure it meets the required criteria.
4. **Database Interaction**: Validated data is then inserted into the MySQL database securely.
5. **Confirmation**: Upon successful submission, users receive confirmation messages.
